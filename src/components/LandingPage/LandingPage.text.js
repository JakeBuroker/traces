You should have received an email from the “Walker Art Center” confirming the date and time of your investigation work. You also will receive reminders via text message in the days leading up to it. 

On the date and time of your appointment, please stand at the Northeast corner of Hennepin Avenue and South 4th Street in downtown Minneapolis (same block as Minneapolis Central Library) and await a phone call from our agency. We will call you on the number that you shared upon registration. If weather is inclement, please feel free to wait in the entryway of Minneapolis Central Library, just through the first set of glass doors.

Traffic and parking can be difficult downtown, so please be sure to arrive early to get in place. You may use the restroom on the ground level of Minneapolis Central Library if needed prior to your appointment. Please review the training video (available for review under the HELP tab) before arrival. Be sure to fully charge your smartphone and bring wired headphones.
